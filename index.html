<p>Nepal's citizen communities and civil society groups are putting a lot of effort in dealing with the aftermath of the series of earthquakes that started on 25th April. Much of these efforts are being coordinated using Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter or personal communication. It is hard for people to keep in track of the needs, availabilities and actions at various places. As the crisis draws longer, we could use better tools to facilitate co-ordinate and keep track.</p>

<p>Let us join hands. This website acts as a place to aggregate all information useful to the people on ground and those willing to join.</p>

<p>Information on this website is divided into different themes. Please visit the appropriate sections</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
