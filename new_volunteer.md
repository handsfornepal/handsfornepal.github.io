## How to start volunteering

The crisis in Nepal will probably go in for many more months, if not years. It is better to use our efforts in a co-ordinated manner. Others would be able to keep track of what's going on and what's needed. 

Help from online volunteers will be very useful for those on the ground. We are here to do exactly that.

We have a central tool where all information will be aggregated. It can be found at [quakemaps.org](quakemaps.org). If you are already familiar with Ushahidi platform, please visit the website and have a look. Don't worry if you are not familiar with it. We have prepared paages on this website to help you use that website.

First, to understand what sort of help is required, please read the following pages:

* (Our home page)[index.html]
* (What needs attention)
* (Information on Online Volunteering)
* (Information on on-ground volunteering)

If you think you can help with some of the tasks above, get in touch with us, and start helping. Please read the pages above before you decide to join. If we have to explain the same thing to many people, it is not good use of our time. Once you've done so, get started by doing the following:

* fill out this [form](http://goo.gl/forms/HsU6kABK3B)
* we will get your email address from the form above, on which we'll contact you
* you will receive an invitation to join a chat-room on an online platform called "Slack", please join the room after you are invited
* you can ask questions and discuss in the chat-room
