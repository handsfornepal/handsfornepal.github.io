{"name":"Hands For Nepal","tagline":"Joining hands to solve the crisis faced by our nation","body":"### Let's join Hands for Nepal\r\nNepal's citizen communities and civil society groups are putting a lot of effort in dealing with the aftermath of the series of earthquakes that started on 25th April. Much of these efforts are being coordinated using Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter or personal communication. It is hard for people to keep in track of the needs, availabilities and actions at various places. As the crisis draws longer, we could use better tools to facilitate co-ordinate and keep track.\r\n\r\nLet us join hands. This website acts as a place to aggregate all information useful to the people on ground and those willing to join.\r\n\r\nInformation on this website is divided into different themes. Please visit the appropriate sections\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf you want to help with a computer\r\nIf you want to volunteer on the ground\r\nIf you are already active on the ground\r\nContact details, where to find more information\r\nInformation of what's happening right now, what needs attention\r\n```\r\n\r\n### If you want to help with a computer\r\nIf you cannot participate actively on the ground, there's enough you can do to from the computer as well. Please pick one of the items listed below and start working on it\r\n\r\n### If you want to volunteer on the ground\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
