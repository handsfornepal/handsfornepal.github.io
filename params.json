{"name":"Hands For Nepal","tagline":"Joining hands to solve the crisis faced by our nation","body":"### Let's join Hands for Nepal\r\nNepal's citizen communities and civil society groups are putting a lot of effort in dealing with the aftermath of the series of earthquakes that started on 25th April. Much of these efforts are being coordinated using Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter or personal communication. It is hard for people to keep in track of the needs, availabilities and actions at various places. As the crisis draws longer, we could use better tools to facilitate co-ordinate and keep track.\r\n\r\nLet us join hands. This website acts as a place to aggregate all information useful to the people on ground and those willing to join.\r\n\r\nInformation on this website is divided into different themes. Please visit the appropriate sections\r\n\r\n```\r\n* What requires immediate attention\r\n* If you want to help with a computer\r\n* If you want to volunteer on the ground\r\n* If you are are looking for volunteers\r\n* If you know something important\r\n* Resources: Contact details, where to find more information\r\n* Information of what's happening right now\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What requires immediate attention\r\n\r\n### If you want to help with a computer\r\nIf you cannot participate actively on the ground, there's enough you can do to from the computer as well. Please pick one of the items listed below and start working on it. Ask us if you need help.\r\n\r\n### If you want to volunteer on the ground\r\nIf you have skills useful for other volunteers already active on the ground, please express your interest. Be specific with what skills you have, otherwise you may be adding problem rather than helping. To express your interest to volunteer, follow the steps described here.\r\n\r\n### If you are are looking for volunteers\r\nIf you are looking for volunteers to help, please announce your need. Be specific with that the task is, where the location is, what skills do you expect and how much time and effort is it going to need. Otherwise you might be wasting valuable time of someone who could be useful elsewhere. To announce your need, follow the steps described here.\r\n\r\n### If you know something important\r\nThere are different information circulating around. A place might be in need of some tents, elsewhere some house might have just fallen. Some tents might have extra sleeping space that others might come to use. It is important to inform of such things in a single location so that everyone else can be notified. To report such events, follow the steps described here.\r\n\r\n### Resources: Contact details, where to find more information\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
